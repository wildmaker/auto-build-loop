# PRD: Multi-Agent Delivery Mode Smoke Test

## Goal
Build a small "Team Notes" feature with clear parallel boundaries so multi-agent orchestration is meaningful.

## Scope
- Frontend: add Team Notes screen with list/create/delete actions
- Backend: add CRUD API endpoints `/api/team-notes`
- QA: add API contract tests and one end-to-end checklist

## Constraints
- Keep implementation minimal and test-oriented
- No unrelated refactor
- Use existing project conventions

## Acceptance
- Frontend can list/create/delete notes
- Backend API passes basic contract tests
- QA checklist documents the critical path
